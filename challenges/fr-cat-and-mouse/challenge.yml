  Hints:

  - Perhaps what you''re searching for isn''t in what the image contains, but what the *file* contains.

  - Fun fact: Zip files can be hidden in other kinds of files!

  - Remember that files are just representations of 1s and 0s. How do you see those 1s and 0s? What is hidden in those 1s and 0s?'
