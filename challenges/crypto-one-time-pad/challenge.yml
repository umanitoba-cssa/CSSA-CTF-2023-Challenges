description: 'The AI system is learning slowly how to encrypt their messages! We were able to intercept a message over the wire it was sending to its other AI friend who lives across the world, but we were also able to intercept a message saying it was encrypted using one time pad. However the AI got lazy and only used a key that was 8 bytes, but the message is 21 bytes! See if we can use this oversight to our advantage.


  Hints:

  The key is encrypted in the format cssactf{<message>}

  Convert your binary output to ascii via UTF

  Repeat the 8 byte key to get the real key'
