description: 'Little known fact about AI is that we don''t have to use any specific language. So I have now decided to scramble the entire alphabet because why not. Not only that but I added numbers to the alphabet. Good luck trying to unscramble this.


  Hints:

  Spaces are _''s

  The alphabet is abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
