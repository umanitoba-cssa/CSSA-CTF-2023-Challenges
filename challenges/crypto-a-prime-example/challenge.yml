description: '`Ha! You dumb humans are so bad at cryptography that I decided to give you a head start, not that it will make a

  difference. I encrypted my messages using RSA but not only will I give you the product of both of the primes, I

  will give you the sum as well.`


  Hints:

  - Try combining the equations given to you and note what is a constant (even if its big)

  - Decode the final result to a string from hexadecimal'
